Here you'll find the full code of my new 2025 portfolio - [martin-laxenaire.fr](https://www.martin-laxenaire.fr).

I've decided to publish it as a learning material. You might find some useful inspiration, from small UI components to full [gpu-curtains](https://martinlaxenaire.github.io/gpu-curtains/) WebGPU scenes.
